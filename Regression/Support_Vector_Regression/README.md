# Support Vector Regression: -

Support Vector Machine can also be used as a regression method, maintaining all the main features that characterize the algorithm 
(maximal margin). The Support Vector Regression (SVR) uses the same principles as the SVM for classification, with only
a few minor differences.

In the case of regression, a margin of tolerance (epsilon) is set in approximation to the SVM which would have already requested 
from the problem. However, the main idea is always the same: to minimize error, individualizing the hyperplane which maximizes the margin,
keeping in mind that part of the error is tolerated. But, Support Vectors are not used as often for Regression as they are for 
classification.


### Execution: -

To run the code, type `SVR_Pred.py`

```
run SVR_Pred.py
```
