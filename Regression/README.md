The H.R of a company asks the new hire about his last salary, the employee says that he was a level 6.5
(between Country Manager and Regional Manager) and drew a salary of $165,000. The H.R contacts his
previous employer and gets the Position_Salaries.csv from him.

The dataset Position_Salaries.csv contains the various positions and its corresponding salaries. 
The job is to predict if the new hire was bluffing/telling the truth about his last drawn salary.

We are going to predict above bluff/truth using Polynomial-Regression, SVR, Decision-Tree-Regression and 
Random-Forest-Regression. And to find the best perfoming model.
