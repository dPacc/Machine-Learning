# Position - Salary Predictor

The dataset contains information about "various position levels" and it's corresponding salaries. This is a regression problem as
we have to predict a continuous value.


### Code Requirements

You need to install Anaconda, which is a Python package manager that handles all the dependencies.


### Description


Let's say that the H.R of a company asks the new hire about his previous jobs salary, and the potential new hire says that he was a level 6.5 (between Country Manager and Regional Manager) and drew a salary of $165,000. The H.R then contacts his previous employer and gets the Position_Salaries.csv from him.

The job is to predict if the new hire was bluffing/telling the truth about his last drawn salary.

We are going to predict above bluff/truth using: -

Polynomial-Regression.

SVR.

Decision-Tree-Regression.

Random-Forest-Regression.

```
until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
