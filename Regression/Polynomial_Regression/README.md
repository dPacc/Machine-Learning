# Polynomial Regression: -

A model is said to be linear when its parameters have a Linear relationship. So the model

and

are both linear models. In fact, they are the second order polynomials in one and two variables respectively.

The polynomial models can be used in those situations where the relationship between study and
explanatory variables is curvilinear. Sometimes a nonlinear relationship in a small range of explanatory
variable can also be modeled by polynomials.
