### Simple Linear Regression: -

Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis. 
The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the formula: -

y = c + b*x

where y = estimated dependent variable score,
      c = constant,
      b = regression coefficient,
      x = score on the independent variable.
