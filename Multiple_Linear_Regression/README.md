### Description

The dataset contains 4 parameters: R&D Spending, Marketing, Administration and the State where the startup is located.

Amongst these parameters, we have to find the one which has the most significant impact on the profit so that the client VC firm can make better investment decisions. We are going to use Multiple-Linear Regression to solve this and determine the best parameter by Backward-
Elimination method.
