### Code Requirements

You need to install Anaconda, which is a Python package manager that handles all the dependencies.


### Description


We need to build a model that clusters people based on their Annual Income and their Spending Score at the mall, so that the
mall can optimize their Advertisements to people who mostly likely would spend more.

We are going to predict the above using: -

- K-Means Clustering.

- Heirarchical Clustering.
