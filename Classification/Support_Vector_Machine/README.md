# Support Vector Machine (SVM): -

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be employed for both classification and 
regression purposes. SVMs are more commonly used in classification problems.

In this algorithm, we plot each data item as a point in n-dimensional space (where n is number of features you have) with the
value of each feature being the value of a particular coordinate. Then, we perform classification by finding the hyper-plane
that differentiates the two classes very well.

SVMs are based on the idea of finding a hyperplane that best divides a dataset into two classes like shown below.
