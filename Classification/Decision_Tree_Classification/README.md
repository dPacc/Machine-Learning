# Decision Tree Classification: -

The understanding level of Decision Trees algorithm is so easy compared with other classification algorithms. The decision tree 
algorithm tries to solve the problem, by using tree representation. Each internal node of the tree corresponds to an attribute,
and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. Decision Tree Classifier, repetitively divides the working area(plot) into sub 
part by identifying lines.

### Algorithm Pseudo Code: -

- Place the best attribute of the dataset at the root of the tree.
- Split the training set into subsets. Subsets should be made in such a way that each subset contains data with the same value 
  for an attribute.
- Repeat step 1 and step 2 on each subset until you find leaf nodes in all the branches of the tree.
