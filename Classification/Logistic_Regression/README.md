# Logistic Regression: -

Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).
Logistic regression derives its name from the function it uses at the core of the method, which is the log function. 
Itâ€™s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.
