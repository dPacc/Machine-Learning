# Kernel - Support Vector Machine (Kernel - SVM): -

An SVM is used to separate classes using a hyperplane, here the classes are linearly separable. What if the data points are
non-linear, how do we separate the classes? The answer lies in applying the kernel trick.

Different SVM algorithms use different types of kernel functions. These functions can be different types, for example linear, 
non-linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. The kernel function plot the non-linear data onto an
higher dimension and thereby making it linearly separable. The most widely used kernel function is the - RBF(Radial Basis Function)
or also called as the Gaussian Kernel.
