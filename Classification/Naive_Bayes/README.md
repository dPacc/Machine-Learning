# Naive Bayes: -

It is a classification technique based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. In simple terms, 
a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.
This assumption makes the algorithm "Naive". In real life, it is almost impossible that we get a set of predictors which are 
completely independent.

Bayes theorem provides a way of calculating posterior probability P(c|x) from P(c), P(x) and P(x|c).
