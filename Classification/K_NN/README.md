# K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN): -

KNN can be used for both classification and regression predictive problems. However, it is more widely used in classification problems 
in the industry. K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. It belongs to
the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection.

The “K” is KNN algorithm is the nearest neighbors we wish to take vote from.
